Quick Xenomai installation
==========================

Xenomai is exclusively Adeos-based, so the general steps include
adding the Adeos support to a vanilla Linux kernel first, then build
Xenomai against the resulting kernel tree. Here is how to do this:

>1. patch and build a vanilla Linux kernel tree with the Adeos support.
    For instance, Adeos patches for x86 are available from
    <xeno-src-dir>/arch/i386/patches/. Apply only one of them
    that matches the Linux kernel version, like this:
    $ cd <linux-src-dir>
    $ patch -p1 < arch/<arch>/patches/adeos-linux-<version>.patch

>2. validate Adeos support in the patched kernel then compile+install it 
    then reboot the system on this new Adeos compatible kernel. If you
    run it on a 2.4 based distribution, you need to upgrade 
    module-init-tools (insmod, modprobe, etc.) to version 3.0 or greater.
    You can get it from: 

    ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty/modules

    	
>3  Once you have rebooted, you can create a build directory and compile Xenomai.

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build 
    $ make -f <xeno-src-dir>/makefile menuconfig (or 'xconfig' or 'gconfig')

    In case you get error about missing 'xeno_srctree' (gmake version < 3.80)
    you should add "xeno_srctree=<xeno-src-dir>" to the command line.


>4. a GUI should pop up, allowing you to configure Xenomai:
    o default settings should be ok for most platforms
    o in the "General" section, set your site values for the Xenomai
      installation directory (defaults to /usr/realtime) and
      Linux kernel tree (defaults to the current running kernel).

    o save and exit.

--

At this point, you should see the typical output of a GNU configure
script. Your Xenomai settings are being used to setup the
autoconf/automake-based build system.

--

>5. $ make install

Xenomai will be compiled then installed under the directory you
specified at configuration time (ensure that your shell can write to
the destination directory).

Remember to add <install-dir>/bin to your shell PATH variable, where
<install-dir> is your site value for the Xenomai installation directory.

>6. $ cd <install-dir>/testsuite/latency

>7. $ ./run

If "sudo" is installed on your box, the application loader script
(xeno-load) will attempt to use it for running privileged commands
(e.g. insmod, rmmod et al.) If sudo is not available, just "su"
manually before running the run script. You should then see the
typical output of the latency calibration program running in kernel
space.  Hit ^C to stop it.
