Real-Time Serial Driver for 16550A-Compatible Devices
=====================================================

Driver revision: 1.2.0


Preparation
-----------
 - decide which serial ports are to be managed by the real-time driver

 - identify their I/O addresses and IRQ numbers:

   setserial /dev/ttyS<N>

 - disable the Linux driver for all these devices:

   setserial /dev/ttyS<N> uart none


Invocation
----------

modprobe xeno_16550A ioaddr=<io1>[,<io2>...] irq=<irq1>[,<irq2>...]
                     [baud_base=<base1>[,<base2>...]]
                     [tx_fifo=<len1>[,<len2>...]] [start_index=<index>]

Arguments:
    ioaddr      - I/O addresses of the devices, comma separated
                  (e.g. "0x3f8,0x2f8")
    irq         - interrupt numbers of the devices, comma separated
                  (e.g. "4,3")
    baud_base   - Maximum baud rates of the devices, comma separated, default
                  is 115200
    tx_fifo     - Transmitter FIFO sizes of the devices in bytes, comma
                  separated, default is 16
    start_index - First device instance number to be used, default is 0
                  (=> "rtser0")


Usage
-----

The API is described in the API documentation under Modules -> Real-Time
Driver Model -> Device Profiles -> Serial Devices.
