 *
 * Clocks and timers services.
 *
 * Xenomai POSIX skin supports two clocks.
 *
 * CLOCK_REALTIME maps to the nucleus system clock, keeping time as the amount
 * of time since the Epoch, with a resolution of one system clock tick. The
 * duration of the system clock tick depends on the settings of the nucleus
 * (configurable at compile-time with @a CONFIG_XENO_OPT_TIMING_PERIOD, and at
 * run-time with the module parameter @a tick_arg). When the system timer is set
 * to aperiodic mode, the default, the system clock tick is one nanosecond.
 *
 * CLOCK_MONOTONIC maps to an architecture-dependent high resolution counter, so
 * is suitable for measuring short time intervals. However, when used for
 * sleeping (with clock_nanosleep()), the CLOCK_MONOTONIC clock has a resolution
 * of one system clock tick, like the CLOCK_REALTIME clock.
 *
 * Setting any of the two clocks with clock_settime() is currently not
 * supported.
 *
 * Timer objects may be created with the timer_create() service using either of
 * the two clocks, but the resolution of these timers is one system clock tick,
 * as is the case for clock_nanosleep().
 *
