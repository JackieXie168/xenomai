config XENO_SKIN_RTDM
	depends on XENO_OPT_NUCLEUS
	tristate "Real-Time Driver Model"
	default y
	help

	This API skin allows to write real-time drivers against a common
	light weight interface in kernel mode, but use them across all other
	skins in both kernel and user mode.

config XENO_OPT_RTDM_FILDES
	int "Maximum number of RTDM file descriptors"
	depends on XENO_SKIN_RTDM
	default 128
	help

	This option defines the maximum number of RTDM file descriptors
	which can be opened at the same time. RTDM file descriptors are
	a global resource all applications share, either via the RTDM skin
	directly or via the embedded services of the POSIX skin.

config XENO_OPT_DEBUG_RTDM
	bool "RTDM debugging support"
	depends on XENO_OPT_DEBUG && XENO_SKIN_RTDM
	help

	This option activates debugging checks for the RTDM subsystem.
	It is a recommended option for analysing potential issues in RTDM
	drivers. A minor runtime overhead is added.
