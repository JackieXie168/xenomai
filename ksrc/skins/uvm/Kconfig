	This feature provides support for running applications based
	on legacy RTOS APIs inside virtual machines in user-space
	with hard real-time capabilities. The application and the RTOS
	will be self-contained and sandboxed in a single regular Linux
	process.

	This feature is deprecated, and will be removed from the next
	major Xenomai release. Applications should rather use
	the system call interface library available with the
	real-time skin of interest (e.g. link against libvxworks.so
	instead of libvxworks_uvm.so), which directly invokes
	real-time services implemented by the skin module, on behalf
	of the Linux process.
