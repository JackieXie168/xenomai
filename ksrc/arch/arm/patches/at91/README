This directory contains the needed support for running Adeos over boards based
on the Atmel AT91 processor.

Apply the following patches in this order, against a vanilla 2.6.15 kernel:

- 2.6.15-at91.patch.gz
- ../adeos-ipipe-2.6.15-arm-1.5-08.patch
- ipipe-2.6.15-at91-1.5-08.patch

IMPORTANT NOTE: Because the timer frequency need to be known at
compilation-time, you will have to set-up the CONFIG_IPIPE_AT91_MCK variable to
your board master clock frequency when configuring the patched kernel. If this
setting is incorrect, the kernel will panic at boot time, and display the
correct value.
