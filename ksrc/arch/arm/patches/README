-- arch/arm/patches

Xenomai needs special kernel support to deliver fast and
deterministic response time to external interrupts, and also to
provide real-time services highly integrated with the standard Linux
kernel.

This support is provided by the Adeos real-time enabler [1], in the
form of a kernel patch you have to apply against a vanilla kernel
tree, before you attempt to compile the Xenomai codebase against the
latter kernel.

Apply one of the patches found in this directory to the corresponding
kernel release. You may want to have a look at the README.*INSTALL
guides at the top of the Xenomai tree for more information.

This directory only contains the most recent patches; you may find the
complete collection of Adeos/I-pipe patches at the following
location (see note):

* all existing I-pipe patches for the combo ARM architecture:
http://download.gna.org/adeos/patches/v2.6/arm/

NOTE: not all these patches are guaranteed to work with the current
Xenomai release.  However, there is a good chance most of them do,
since we try hard to maintain backward compatibility.
