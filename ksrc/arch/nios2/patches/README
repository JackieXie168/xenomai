-- arch/nios2/patches

Xenomai needs special kernel support to deliver fast and deterministic
response time to external interrupts, and also to provide real-time
services highly integrated with the standard Linux kernel.

This support is provided by the Adeos real-time enabler [1], in the
form of a kernel patch you have to apply against a vanilla kernel
tree, before you attempt to compile the Xenomai codebase against the
latter kernel.

For the NIOS2 architecture, I-pipe patches are based on Thomas Chou's
<thomas@wytron.com.tw> public tree [2].

This directory only contains the most recent patches used to validate
this Xenomai release on nios2 platforms; you may find the complete
collection of Adeos/I-pipe patches at the following location (see
note): http://download.gna.org/adeos/patches/v2.6/nios2

NOTE: not all these patches are guaranteed to work with the current
Xenomai release.  However, there is a good chance most of them do,
since we try hard to maintain backward compatibility.
