 * \fn int xnpod_init(xnpod_t *pod,int loprio,int hiprio,xnflags_t flags)
 * \brief Initialize a new pod.
 *
 * Initializes a new pod which can subsequently be used to start
 * real-time activities. Once a pod is active, real-time APIs can be
 * stacked over. There can only be a single pod active in the host
 * environment. Such environment can be confined to a process
 * (e.g. simulator or UVM), or expand machine-wide (e.g. Adeos).
 *
 * @param pod The address of a pod descriptor the nucleus will use to
 * store the pod-specific data.  This descriptor must always be valid
 * while the pod is active therefore it must be allocated in permanent
 * memory.
 *
 * @param loprio The value of the lowest priority level which is valid
 * for threads created on behalf of this pod.
 *
 * @param hiprio The value of the highest priority level which is
 * valid for threads created on behalf of this pod.
 *
 * @param flags A set of creation flags affecting the operation.  The
 * only defined flag is XNREUSE, which tells the nucleus that a
 * pre-existing pod exhibiting the same properties as the one which is
 * being registered may be reused. In such a case, the call returns
 * successfully, keeping the active pod unmodified.
 *
 * loprio may be numerically greater than hiprio if the client
 * real-time interface exhibits a reverse priority scheme. For
 * instance, some APIs may define a range like loprio=255, hiprio=0
 * specifying that thread priorities increase as the priority level
 * decreases numerically.
 *
 * @return 0 is returned on success. Otherwise:
 *
 * - -EBUSY is returned if a pod already exists. As a special
 * exception, if the Xenomai pod is currently loaded with no active
 * attachment onto it, it is forcibly unloaded and replaced by the new
 * pod.
 *
 * - -ENOMEM is returned if the memory manager fails to initialize.
 *
 * Environments:
 *
 * This service can be called from:
 *
 * - Kernel module initialization code
 *
 * @note No initialization code called by this routine may refer to
 * the global "nkpod" pointer.

 * debugging GUI it provides. However, passing NULL here is always
 * legal and means "anonymous".
 *
 * @param prio The base priority of the new thread. This value must
 * range from [loprio .. hiprio] (inclusive) as specified when calling
 * the xnpod_init() service.
 *
 * @param flags A set of creation flags affecting the operation. The
 * following flags can be part of this bitmask, each of them affecting
 * the nucleus behaviour regarding the created thread:
 *
 * - XNSUSP creates the thread in a suspended state. In such a case,
 * the thread will have to be explicitely resumed using the
 * xnpod_resume_thread() service for its execution to actually begin,
 * additionally to issuing xnpod_start_thread() for it. This flag can
 * also be specified when invoking xnpod_start_thread() as a starting
 * mode.

 * - XNFPU (enable FPU) tells the nucleus that the new thread will use
 * the floating-point unit. In such a case, the nucleus will handle
 * the FPU context save/restore ops upon thread switches at the
 * expense of a few additional cycles per context switch. By default,
 * a thread is not expected to use the FPU. This flag is simply
 * ignored when the nucleus runs on behalf of a userspace-based
 * real-time control layer since the FPU management is always active
 * if present.
 *
 * - XNINVPS tells the nucleus that the new thread will use an
 * inverted priority scale with respect to the one enforced by the
 * current pod. This means that the calling skin will still have to
 * normalize the priority levels passed to the nucleus routines so
 * that they conform to the pod's priority scale, but the nucleus will
 * automatically rescale those values when displaying the priority
 * information (e.g. /proc/xenomai/sched output). This bit must not be
 * confused with the XNRPRIO bit, which is internally set by the
 * nucleus during pod initialization when the low priority level is
 * found to be numerically higher than the high priority bound. Having
 * the XNINVPS bit set for a thread running on a pod with XNRPRIO
 * unset means that the skin emulates a decreasing priority scale
 * using the pod's increasing priority scale. This is typically the
 * case for skins running over the core pod (see
 * include/nucleus/core.h).
 *
 * @param stacksize The size of the stack (in bytes) for the new
 * thread. If zero is passed, the nucleus will use a reasonable
 * pre-defined size depending on the underlying real-time control
 * layer.
 *
 * After creation, the new thread can be set a magic cookie by skins
 * using xnthread_set_magic() to unambiguously identify threads
 * created in their realm. This value will be copied as-is to the @a
 * magic field of the thread struct. 0 is a conventional value for "no
 * magic".
 *
 * @return 0 is returned on success. Otherwise, one of the following
 * error codes indicates the cause of the failure:
 *
 *         - -EINVAL is returned if @a flags has invalid bits set.
 *
 *         - -ENOMEM is returned if not enough memory is available
 *         from the system heap to create the new thread's stack.
 *
 * Side-effect: This routine does not call the rescheduling procedure.
 *
 * Environments:
 *
 * This service can be called from:
 *
 * - Kernel module initialization/cleanup code
 * - Kernel-based task

 *
 * - XNASDI disables the asynchronous signal handling for this thread.
 * See xnpod_schedule() for more on this.
 *
 * - XNSHIELD enables the interrupt shield for the current user-space
 * task. When engaged, the interrupt shield protects the shadow task
 * running in secondary mode from any preemption by the regular Linux
 * interrupt handlers, without delaying in any way Xenomai's interrupt
 * handling. The shield is operated on a per-task basis at each

 *
 * - XNSUSP. This flag forcibly suspends a thread, regardless of any

 * specifying the XNSUSP bit must be issued to remove this condition,
 * which is cumulative with other suspension bits.@a wchan should be
 * NULL when using this suspending mode.
 *
 * - XNDELAY. This flags denotes a counted delay wait (in ticks) which
 * duration is defined by the value of the timeout parameter.
 *
 * - XNPEND. This flag denotes a wait for a synchronization object to
 * be signaled. The wchan argument must points to this object. A
 * timeout value can be passed to bound the wait. This suspending mode
 * should not be used directly by the client interface, but rather
 * through the xnsynch_sleep_on() call.
 *
 * @param timeout The timeout which may be used to limit the time the
 * thread pends for a resource. This value is a wait time given in
 * ticks (see note).  Passing XN_INFINITE specifies an unbounded
 * wait. All other values are used to initialize a watchdog timer.  If
 * the current operation mode is oneshot and @a timeout elapses before
 * xnpod_suspend_thread() has completed, then the target thread will
 * not be suspended, and this routine leads to a null effect.
 *
 * @param wchan The address of a pended resource. This parameter is
 * used internally by the synchronization object implementation code
 * to specify on which object the suspended thread pends. NULL is a
 * legitimate value when this parameter does not apply to the current
 * suspending mode (e.g. XNSUSP).

	   the shadow thread at the nucleus level, whilst this thread
	   is actually running some code under the control of the
	   Linux scheduler (i.e. it's relaxed).  To make this
	   possible, we force the target Linux task to migrate back to
	   the Xenomai domain by sending it a SIGHARDEN signal the
	   skin interface libraries trap for this specific internal
	   purpose, whose handler is expected to call back the
	   nucleus's migration service. By forcing this migration, we
	   make sure that the real-time nucleus controls, hence
	   properly stops, the target thread according to the
	   requested suspension condition. Otherwise, the shadow
	   thread in secondary mode would just keep running into the
	   Linux domain, thus breaking the most common assumptions
	   regarding suspended threads. We only care for threads that
	   are not current, and for XNSUSP and XNDELAY conditions,
	   because:

	   - skins are supposed to ask for primary mode switch when
	   processing any syscall which may block the caller; IOW,
	   __xn_exec_primary must be set in the mode flags for those. So
	   there is no need to deal specifically with the relax+suspend
	   issue when the about to be suspended thread is current, since
	   it must not be relaxed anyway.

	   - among all blocking bits (XNTHREAD_BLOCK_BITS), only
	   XNSUSP, XNDELAY and XNHELD may be applied by the current
	   thread to a non-current thread. XNPEND is always added by
	   the caller to its own state, XNDORMANT is a pre-runtime
	   state, and XNRELAX has special semantics escaping this
	   issue.

	   Also note that we don't signal threads which are in a
	   dormant state, since they are suspended by definition.

 * \fn void xnpod_schedule(void)
 * \brief Rescheduling procedure entry point.
 *
 * This is the central rescheduling routine which should be called to
 * validate and apply changes which have previously been made to the
 * nucleus scheduling state, such as suspending, resuming or
 * changing the priority of threads.  This call first determines if a
 * thread switch should take place, and performs it as
 * needed. xnpod_schedule() actually switches threads if:
 *
 * - the running thread has been blocked or deleted.
 * - or, the running thread has a lower priority than the first
 *   ready to run thread.
 * - or, the running thread does not lead no more the ready threads
 * (round-robin).
 *
 * The nucleus implements a lazy rescheduling scheme so that most
 * of the services affecting the threads state MUST be followed by a
 * call to the rescheduling procedure for the new scheduling state to
 * be applied. In other words, multiple changes on the scheduler state
 * can be done in a row, waking threads up, blocking others, without
 * being immediately translated into the corresponding context
 * switches, like it would be necessary would it appear that a higher
 * priority thread than the current one became runnable for
 * instance. When all changes have been applied, the rescheduling
 * procedure is then called to consider those changes, and possibly
 * replace the current thread by another one.
 *
 * As a notable exception to the previous principle however, every
 * action which ends up suspending or deleting the current thread
 * begets an immediate call to the rescheduling procedure on behalf of
 * the service causing the state transition. For instance,
 * self-suspension, self-destruction, or sleeping on a synchronization
 * object automatically leads to a call to the rescheduling procedure,
 * therefore the caller does not need to explicitely issue
 * xnpod_schedule() after such operations.
 *
 * The rescheduling procedure always leads to a null-effect if it is
 * called on behalf of an ISR or callout. Any outstanding scheduler
 * lock held by the outgoing thread will be restored when the thread
 * is scheduled back in.
 *
 * Calling this procedure with no applicable context switch pending is
 * harmless and simply leads to a null-effect.
 *
 * Side-effects:

 * - If an asynchronous service routine exists, the pending
 * asynchronous signals are delivered to a resuming thread or on
 * behalf of the caller before it returns from the procedure if no
 * context switch has taken place. This behaviour can be disabled by
 * setting the XNASDI flag in the thread's status mask by calling
 * xnpod_set_thread_mode().
 * 
 * Environments:
 *
 * This service can be called from:
 *
 * - Kernel module initialization/cleanup code
 * - Interrupt service routine, although this leads to a no-op.
 * - Kernel-based task
 * - User-space task
 *
 * @note The switch hooks are called on behalf of the resuming thread.

 *
 * The nucleus needs a time source to provide the time-related
 * services to the upper interfaces. xnpod_start_timer() tunes the
 * timer hardware so that a user-defined routine is called according
 * to a given frequency. On architectures that provide a
 * oneshot-programmable time source, the system timer can operate
 * either in aperiodic or periodic mode. Using the aperiodic mode
 * still allows to run periodic timings over it: the underlying
 * hardware will simply be reprogrammed after each tick by the timer
 * manager using the appropriate interval value (see xntimer_start()).
 *
 * The time interval that elapses between two consecutive invocations
 * of the handler is called a tick.
 *
 * @param nstick The timer period in nanoseconds. XNPOD_DEFAULT_TICK
 * can be used to set this value according to the arch-dependent
 * settings. If this parameter is equal to XN_APERIODIC_TICK, the
 * underlying hardware timer is set to operate in oneshot-programming
 * mode. In this mode, timing accuracy is higher - since it is not
 * rounded to a constant time slice. The aperiodic mode gives better
 * results in configuration involving threads requesting timing
 * services over different time scales that cannot be easily expressed
 * as multiples of a single base tick, or would lead to a waste of
 * high frequency periodical ticks.
 *
 * @param tickhandler The address of the tick handler which will process
 * each incoming tick. XNPOD_DEFAULT_TICKHANDLER can be passed to use
 * the system-defined entry point (i.e. xnpod_announce_tick()). In any
 * case, a user-supplied handler should end up calling
 * xnpod_announce_tick() to inform the nucleus of the incoming
 * tick.
 *
 * @return 0 is returned on success. Otherwise:
 *
 * - -EBUSY is returned if the timer has already been set with
 * incompatible requirements (different mode, different period if
 * periodic, or different handler).  xnpod_stop_timer() must be issued
 * before xnpod_start_timer() is called again.
 *
 * - -EINVAL is returned if an invalid null tick handler has been
 * passed, or if the timer precision cannot represent the duration of
 * a single host tick.
 *
 * - -ENODEV is returned if the underlying architecture does not
 * support the requested periodic timing.
 *
 * - -ENOSYS is returned if no active pod exists.
 *
 * Side-effect: A host timing service is started in order to relay the
 * canonical periodical tick to the underlying architecture,
 * regardless of the frequency used for Xenomai's system
 * tick. This routine does not call the rescheduling procedure.

 * Environments:
