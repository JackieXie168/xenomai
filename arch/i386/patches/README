-- arch/i386/patches

Xenomai needs special kernel support to deliver fast and deterministic
response time to external interrupts, and also to provide real-time
services highly integrated with the standard Linux kernel.

This support is provided by the Adeos real-time enabler [1], in the
form of a kernel patch you have to apply to a vanilla kernel tree,
before you attempt to compile the Xenomai codebase against the latter
kernel.

On the x86 architecture, Xenomai can run over the former and the new
generation of Adeos patches, namely adeos-linux-* and adeos-ipipe-*,
that one can find in this directory. Just apply one of those patches
to the corresponding kernel release. You may want to have a look at
the README.*INSTALL guides at the top of the Xenomai tree for more
information.
